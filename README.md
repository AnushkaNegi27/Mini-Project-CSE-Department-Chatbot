# Mini-Project-CSE-Department-Chatbot

## Description
This is a mini project aimed at developing a chatbot for the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to handle department-related queries. The project includes scripts for training the model, utility functions for preprocessing and text analysis, and supporting documents such as a research paper, report, and a presentation.

## Features
- Responds to queries related to the CSE department.
- Built using NLP techniques, with a focus on stemming and text preprocessing.
- Can be trained with custom data to enhance responses.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mini-Project-CSE-Department-Chatbot.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Mini-Project-CSE-Department-Chatbot
3. Install the required dependencies (use a virtual environment for better management):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, install the necessary dependencies manually, such as:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk numpy

## Usage
1. Train the chatbot model by running the `training.py` script:
   ```bash
   python training.py
2. After training, run the chatbot using the following command:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py

The chatbot will be ready to answer CSE department-related queries.
