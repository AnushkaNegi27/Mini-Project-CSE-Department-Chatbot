# CSE Department Chatbot

A smart, interactive chatbot designed for the Computer Science & Engineering Department at Graphic Era Hill University. This chatbot answers department-related queries using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and provides a sleek web interface with avatars, timestamps, and a responsive UI.

---

## Description

This project uses PyTorch-based NLP techniques to classify user queries and respond accurately using a custom dataset. It is integrated with a Flask backend and a modern HTML/CSS frontend.

---

## Features

- üîç Query classification using bag-of-words and a neural network
- üí¨ Dynamic, styled frontend with user and bot avatars
- ‚è∞ Timestamps and smooth chat experience
- üåê Web-based using Flask (no Tkinter!)
- üì¶ Clean file structure, virtual environment isolated
